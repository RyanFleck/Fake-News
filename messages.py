def fake_news_intro():
    return '''Three days ago in a shocking turn of events, it was revealed that
    several important events had recently taken place that would change the course 
    of history in our city. In just a few short years, nobody believed
    that our society would ever see the levels of everything we have been experiencing. 
    Ha. What a time we live in. This is very, very, very fake news if you haven't clued
    in already. It's a tool. For you. Lmao. Here! Gratis, a tool to use and enjoy after the
    nihilism really sets in, just to mess with your friends. Use by typing whatever
    you want after the URL, for instance, '(site)/dog steals seventeen ham sandwiches'
    or '(site)/how did (friend) mess up so bad?'. Alternatively, you can also provide
    a category like '(site)/Economics/Student Bradley G scores record low on math final'.
    That's all this does. Apart from generate a body. Welcome to journalism.
